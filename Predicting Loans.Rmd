Our dataset is an output of variables recorded by Prosper, which is a marketplace lending platform based in the U.S. The website allows for peer-to-peer borrowing and is a popular platform for individuals to invest in loans. Our project will entails exploring and analysing the dataset, with the ultimate goal of predicting loan default of future customers.

We go ahead and read in our dataset and load the necessary packages.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(lubridate)
listings <- read.csv("Listings2013.csv")
```

As part of our exploration of our dataset, we find several variables to be irrelevant to further analysis. The variables deleted are found irrelevant as they are aggregate variables or identical variables.
```{r}
listings$number_of_days <- NULL
listings$principal_balance <- NULL
listings$loan_status_description <- NULL
listings$prosper_rating <- NULL
listings$listing_monthly_payment <- NULL
```

For predictive purposes we will go ahead and assume that incomplete loans which are paid per schedule will be completed per schedule. Similarly, we will convert loans which are sold off to colleciton agencies as defaulted.
```{r}
listings$loan_status[listings$loan_status == 4] <- 1
listings$loan_status[listings$loan_status == 3] <- 2
```

For the starting date of each loan, we will go ahead and convert this to a numeric figure. This is done for the predictive algorithms to interpret the date variable correctly. 
```{r}
listings$loan_origination_date <- as.Date(listings$loan_origination_date, "%m/%d/%Y")
listings$loan_origination_date <- as.numeric(listings$loan_origination_date)
listings$loan_origination_date <- listings$loan_origination_date-15705
```

#
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
